- **Shopping Cart**: Full cart functionality for both authenticated and guest users with stock validation
- **Order Management**: End-to-end order lifecycle handling with order items
- **Payment Processing**: Flexible payment integration with transaction tracking
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger/ReDoc
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into separate Django apps for maintainability and scalability
- **Permission System**: Granular permissions with read-only access for public endpoints
